    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 2-3-4_B_Tree_Project Project Overview
========================================================================

This was created for an advanced data structures class. I did not worry about
proper deletion of raw pointers as the primary focus was the operation of the tree.
So don't copy and paste this thinking it won't leak. I left Height() and NodeCount() as
todo's. Once you figure out that a 2-3-4 tree is a B tree you can find more resources
to help you if you get stuck.

Gives a good walkthrough of the deltion algorithms. I referenced Data Structures & Algorithms
in Java by Robert Lafore as well to get started. Hope that helps.
